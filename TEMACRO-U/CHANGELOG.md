A rework from the ground up, below are a list of all of the changes if you're interested.
- This theme will no longer be using Theme Source, and will it's own source instead of relying on it. This allows me to have better maintainability and management of the theme.
- Switched to (mostly) custom variables for coloring things instead of only relying on Discord's. This helps with more customization, tho stuff may still be a bit wonky.
- Changed to a module system instead of relying on `@import`.
    - **NOTE: In the future, Powercord will have to use a compiled version of the theme, as this system will not work in v3.**
- File structure has been redone a bit, inspired by **[Slate](https://github.com/DiscordStyles/Slate)** and **[Nebula](https://github.com/Loremly/Nebula)**.
- **[usrbg](https://github.com/Discord-Custom-Covers/usrbg)** is now removed due to it violating Powercord's guidelines.
    - For those in the **[Powercord Discord Server](https://discord.gg/gs4ZMbBfCh)**, you can find more information about this change **[here](https://canary.discord.com/channels/538759280057122817/755012671837044797/847269429699411969)**
- Things that were "too dark" should now be more visible.
- The AMOLED-Cord watermark is now the version of the theme.
- Major color adjustments overall to make the theme look better.

<summary><b> Version 1.0.0 - Version 1.1.1 Changelog </b></summary>

# Version 1.1.1
Small changes to the colored user connections addon.

# Version 1.1.0
A few minor changes and additions.
- Made some things brighter, as they were too dark and not noticeable. This closes [issue #6](https://github.com/LuckFire/amoled-cord/issues/6) and [issue #7](https://github.com/LuckFire/amoled-cord/issues/7).
- Added **[Tropical's](https://github.com/Tropix126)** [usrbg](https://github.com/Discord-Custom-Covers/usrbg), **[NYRI4's](https://github.com/NYRI4)** [Discolored](https://github.com/NYRI4/Discolored) and colored user connections as new addons.
- Removed the bottom chat indicator bar. It appeared that most users disliked this, so I bonked it.
- Reconstructed the file structure a bit.

If you notice anything that is too dark for the theme, make an issue on this repo. Also, please leave feedback on how you feel about the new addons.

# Version 1.0.4
Probably unnecessary for a version bump, but BetterDiscord and Web support has finally been added! If you notice any issues, please read **[this part](https://github.com/LuckFire/amoled-cord#issue-reporting)** of the readme on issue reporting.

# Version 1.0.3
Some small enhancements.
- Updated the import for [Theme Source](https://github.com/luckfire/theme-source) to use the github pages link. 
- Added a new indicator for when the chatbar is active.

# Version 1.0.2
Hopefully a fix for the source not consistently importing.

# Version 1.0.1
Recent changes as [Theme Source](https://github.com/luckfire/theme-source) has been redone.
- Tinkered with the colors a bit, mainly the ones that still used Discord's default ones.
- A nicer looking light theme warning (thank you snapper c:).
- Version has been bumped down: v1.1.0 -> v1.0.1
- Redid the entire repo. Looks nicer, right?!

BetterDiscord & Web support will (hopefully) be coming soon!

# Version 1.0.0
Inital release.
